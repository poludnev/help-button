# help-button

just for fun 'help button'

The app is made based on react-creat-app, internationalised with i18next library.

Oct 18, 2021: add sending from process, currently for localhost.

Next step is to add form validator, it is supposed to be the yup.

## What's the idea?

At the moment it is a 'just-for-fun application. Someone asks for help or advice, and we try to give
some. It was designed by a freelancer (whose name I forgot) in 2015 to my concept with Jquery and
Joomla. Something went wrong when I tried to deploy it. I tried to understand what was going wrong,
and that was how I discovered JavaScript. I believe that this is that 'start' button for my learning
JS.

Now I've reworked it from scratch to make the React app, just kept the original design.

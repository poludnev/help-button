# help-button

just for fun 'help button'

The app is made based on react-creat-app, internationalised with i18next library.

On Oct 12, 2021, is waiting for the form validator to be added, it is supposed to be the yup.

After the validator to be attached, the next step is to complete the form data sending code.

## What's the idea?

At the moment it is a 'just-for-fun application. Someone asks for help or advice, and we try to give
some. It was designed by a freelancer (whose name I forgot) in 2015 to my concept with Jquery and
Joomla. Something went wrong when I tried to deploy it. I tried to understand what was going wrong,
and that was how I discovered JavaScript. I believe that this is that 'start' button for my learning
JS.

Now I've reworked it from scratch to make the React app, just kept the original design.
